# ESLint

A fully pluggable tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.

ESLint is about **coding styles** enforcement: style conventions such as indentation, curly braces style or multi-line strings.
No rules are enabled by default. The "extends": "eslint:recommended" property in a configuration file enables rules that report common problems.

See the list of [rules](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/) you can set.
